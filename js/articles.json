The new brand topped $100,000 in sales in its first weekend.</p> <p>All of which begs the question: What's the secret to Saatva's success?</p> <p>The answer, it seems, lies largely with the fact that Saatva has ignored most of today's entrepreneurial norms. Here's a look at how Saatva is rocketing to success by veering off the beaten path.</p> <h2>1. It isn't targeting millennials.</h2> <p>Warby Parker, Casper, Dollar Shave Club--take a look at some of the biggest names in the startup e-commerce world right now, and you'll notice that most of them have one thing in common: They're targeting millennial consumers.</p> <p>But Zenhaven has taken a different approach. "We found that you can build a really successful business not targeting people under 35," says CMO and Co-Founder Ricky Joshi. The brand appeals to its demographic with perks designed for homeowners (such as in-home delivery and installation and old mattress removal) and through luxury marketing.</p> <p>Much like Tesla has done for cars, Saatva has pulled off the impressive feat of targeting mature consumers while simultaneously building a fresh, hip brand.</p> <h2>2. Its founders are cross-generational.</h2> <p>Log onto the "about us" page of a lot of big-name startups, and you'll see a sea of twenty- and thirty-something faces. Saatva is different. Its founders span multiple generations--Ron Rudzin is in his fifties, while Ricky Joshi and Kris Brower are in their thirties--and the company has advisors in their sixties.</p> <p>This unusual pairing has proved central to the success of Saatva and Zenhaven. "Ron already had a consumer goods background and a lot of experience," says Joshi. Meanwhile, Joshi and Brower brought digital marketing and social media know-how to the table. By giving each other space to run with their respective strengths, the company has grown organically--and quickly.</p> <p>"I trust Ron will execute on the mattress and customer service part of the business, and Ron trusts that Kris and I will execute on the e-commerce side," says Joshi. "It's worked amazingly well."</p> <h2>3. It's not beholden to investors.</h2> <p>Instead of hopping into bed with investors right out of the gate, the company's founders decided to bootstrap their way to where they are now.</p> <p>"For the first two or three years, we really weren't even paying ourselves," says Joshi. "I was moonlighting to pay the bills." The team also saved money by managing our own advertising accounts, technology infrastructure,,and website from scratch. "We took on a lot of risk," acknowledges Joshi.</p> <p>But with that risk came reward. "Because we lived and breathed [the company] and weren't beholden to investors, we've been able to make our own decisions," says Joshi. "We haven't followed the normal road. And I think that's why we've grown so fast."</p> <h2>4. It's launched multiple brands within a brand.</h2> <p>Most investors advise startups to channel all of their energy into building an increasingly large and cohesive brand, with the ultimate goal of becoming the next Facebook or Amazon. By diversifying across three different brands, Saatva has taken an entirely different approach.</p> <p>"It's all part of the founders' mission to make decisions that are best for the customer," says CEO Rudzin. Segmenting across three brands, he says, "allows us to give customers a much more immersive experience." Each brand offers a different user experience and allows the company's target demographic to self-select per their personal preferences for mattress type and pricing.</p> <p>Diversifying in this way isn't without its downsides. "The challenge of running three different brands is that there's three of everything--which requires three times the effort," says Joshi. Still, Saatva's founders are confident that their decision to launch multiple brands under the same umbrella has been a core component of their success - and so far early <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/zenhaven/">reviews of Zenhaven</a> look promising.</p> <h2>5. It's making green living affordable (aka expanding niche markets).</h2> <p>Rudzin is the first to admit that Zenhaven is geared toward a niche market. The brand's mattresses are made from 100% natural American Talalay latex, layered with organic wool, and wrapped in organic cotton. They're also handcrafted in the United States. And until Zenhaven came onto the market, a mattress that met those qualifications could run upwards of $6,000. (In contrast, Zenhaven's Queen size mattress retails for $1,899.)</p> <p>"We did everything possible to make sure we were American made, American supplied, ethically sourced, and ethically built," says Rudzin. "It did cost us more money."</p> <p>But instead of passing that cost onto the consumers, Zenhaven reduces its own overhead by being disciplined with marketing and relying on the lessons learned during Saatva's bootstrapping years.</p> <p>"The next opportunity in e-commerce is green," says Joshi. "And we want to show people that &nbsp;100% natural doesn't have to cost a million dollars."</p> <p>From its product to its customers, Saatva is doing things differently. In the process, it's proving that success can be found by thinking outside the boxspring.&nbsp;</p>",

			http: //www.saatvamattress.com/" rel="nofollow">Saatva Mattress</a> was one of the first brands to offer direct-to-consumer mattresses, and while it provides in-home installation, mattress removal, and a 75-day trial, the biggest difference between Saatva and similar brands is that it gives a choice of three categories/comfort levels of mattress, from plush soft to firm.</p> <p><strong>Why it’s different:</strong> If you have no idea what kind of bed you want to sleep on, Saatva offers a signature Luxury Firm option that it compares to beds used in the finest hotels in the world.

			long_description: "<p>Anyone who has tried it lately can probably attest that mattress shopping isn’t exactly a bed of roses. Bed-in-a-box foam mattress e-tailers like Casper and Tuft and Needle have rightly earned rave reviews for cutting both cost and hassle. But comparing foam against traditional innerspring coil mattresses is misleading. It’s the exact sort of comparison that further obfuscates an already maddening decision between a dozen bone-white rectangles that all look and seem very much the same.</p> <p>In the recent tradition of a transparency-forward, online-only retail, there’s another contender rousing the rest of the industry from its fitful slumber: Saatva, which delivers its dual innerspring coil mattress direct to customers’ doors, at a starting price of $899.</p> <p>With the minimal overhead of e-commerce and despite the slow buying cycle associated with huge durable goods like mattresses, the company, which launched three years ago, has been profitable since its third month. Saatva’s revenue numbers demonstrate its industry stronghold: 300% growth year over year with projected revenue of $25 million this year and $45 million for 2015.</p> <p>It’s hard to understand how one direct-to-consumer mattress company could boast such staggering figures against multi-billion-dollar industry giants like Sealy and Serta. That is, unless you’ve encountered the confusing mattress-buying process punctuated by mystifying markups and obtuse labeling. Head to a mattress outlet, and you might find a one model that seems like a good fit. But try comparison shopping at a department store, and you’ll find what appears to be the exact same mattress listed under another name and sometimes bearing a different price tag. You want simplicity? Dream on.</p> <p>It’s almost easier to chase monsters out from under the bed than evaluate your options. Do you know what a gel mattress is? Does the endorsement of conservative radio hosts impact your opinion about Select Comfort’s Sleep Number adjustable air mattress? Would you sleep on a camouflage-patterned Duck Dynasty bed? Even attempting to assess the toxicity of manufacturing materials, flame-retardant chemicals, and off-gassing is the stuff of vivid nightmares.</p> <p>The Serta, Simmons, and Tempur-Pedic troika have long held an oligopoly in the mattress manufacturer-retailer space. If you think one name is missing from that list, it’s Sealy, which Tempur-Pedic (TPX, +2.24%) acquired in 2012 for $242 million. Major brick-and-mortar retailers have also been tossing and turning. Last month, Mattress Firm, one of the biggest Sealy and Serta retailers, acquired West Coast rival Sleep Train for $425 million cash and stock. Mattress Firm’s public filing in 2008, the last reliable data on the subject, showed that 84% of mattress sales take place in furniture or department stores, or in specialty sleep retailers, which at the time accounted for 42% of sales.</p> <p>Saatva cofounder and chief marketing officer Ricky Joshi notes that his company has basically been in stealth mode, relying on word-of-mouth recommendations and stellar online ratings that highlight the company’s commitment to customer service. Raving reviewers on Google, PriceGrabber, and mattress review sites like Goodbed.com are largely responsible for skyrocketing sales.</p> <p>Since a steel coil innerspring mattress doesn’t roll up and fit tidily into a cardboard shipping box, the company built out a robust nationwide distribution chain, served by 10 factories and 31 distribution centers. Saatva also removes a customer’s old mattress. Boxed mattress sellers tend to put the onus of removing the old mattress on the customer, an annoying pitfall and one that can add to the final cost of a new bed.</p> <p>Even factoring in shipping, Saatva can keep prices lower than competitors by not blowing the budget on advertising and instead leveraging those glowing reviews. Joshi points out that mattress giants often spend more money on marketing than the actual product. A look back at Mattress Firm’s 2011 IPO prospectus, for example, shows that the company spent only $180 million on product compared to $230 million on retail, advertising, and administration in the same period.</p> <p>The company also saves by manufacturing in the U.S. Offering an American-made product was also a priority from the beginning. “There are a lot of question marks from overseas manufacturers,” Joshi says. Importing from overseas is a hassle, and not particularly economical. Besides, what’s more appealing to middle America than durable domestic goods? “It’s nice to be cool in San Francisco and New York City, but we also sell in Dallas, Chicago, and Columbus, Ohio.”</p> <p>It’s hard to say what kind of fierce competition it would take to wake up the legacy mattress giants. And it’s worth wondering: can an e-commerce company like Saatva permanently disrupt the luxury mattress industry? Maybe we should sleep on it.</p>",

			title: "What's Fueling the Boom in Online Mattress Startups?",
			description: "No fewer than six online retailers are vying to sell you a better night's sleep. Here's why the market became so crowded.",
			long_description: "<p>Not too long ago, buying a mattress with a click instead of a trip to a store was virtually unheard of. But now that easy <a href="
			https: //www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/design-great-compression.html">delivery</a> processes and generous return policies have helped online mattress retailers gain traction with consumers, entrepreneurs have taken notice.</p> <p>No fewer than six startups are vying to become the online mattress retailer of choice.&nbsp;The latest entrant is&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.helixsleep.com/">Helix Sleep</a>, which three Wharton grads launched this week. Helix joins&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/2015-30-under-30-casper.html">Casper</a>&nbsp;(one of Inc.'s 30 Under 30 startups), Tuft and Needle, Leesa, Saatva, and&nbsp;Novosbed in what is quickly becoming a very crowded market.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here's what's fueling the online mattress boom.</p> <h2>Brick-and-Mortar Straw Men</h2> <p>Why would three Wharton grads enter this crowded field? In addition to all of the high-profile startups, you have heavyweight incumbents (mattress makers like Tempur Sealy and retailers like Mattress Firm) to deal with.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Helix, which has raised $800,000 from friends and family, the "starting point is customer issues with the current system," says&nbsp;Kristian von Rickenbach, one of the three co-founders. You can boil down those issues to two major points:&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Price:</b>&nbsp;As with the other online players, Helix's prices run in the high triple digits. And while you can now click to buy more varieties of a sub-$1000 mattress than you could at any point in human history, all of the online players can still use the higher prices of brick-and-mortar retailers--whose mattresses can cost as much as $3,000--to set their own sub-$1000 prices in flattering relief.</p> <p><b>Selection and customization:</b>&nbsp;Here's where Helix aims to differentiate itself from some of the other online players.&nbsp;To alleviate the paint point of an overwhelming number of mattress options, Casper sells only its own brand in six different sizes. Helix, however, is betting that a little bit of customization will be more compelling than the one-size-fits-most product approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>"A tall,&nbsp;250-pound man needs a different mattress than a short, 125-pound woman," says co-founder&nbsp;Adam Tishman.</p> <h2>A Smooth Customer Experience</h2> <p>Of course, the challenge is how to present consumers with multiple, customizable options while still providing a smooth and fast online shopping experience. Helix, which is based in New York City, aims to do this in two simple steps. First, shoppers complete a short (two-to-three minute) questionnaire addressing height, weight, sleeping style, and firmness preference.&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, based on responses, Helix creates an individualized mattress along <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.helixsleep.com/research">four parameters</a>: feel (how plush or firm you like it), support (how far and evenly your body sinks into the mattress), temperature regulation (how much heat you lose throughout the night), and something called "point elasticity" (the ability of the materials in the mattress to compress without affecting the quality of the mattress).</p> <p>Does this mean&nbsp;no two customers will get the same mattress from Helix? No, not exactly. "It's impossible to create a completely different mattress for every person from a manufacturing perspective," says Tishman. But he believes that Helix's designs--which he says number in the "low double digits"--can "cover 95 percent of the population."</p> <p>And the company doesn't view its dozen-or-so designs as a static thing; they plan to adjust accordingly, once customer data begins to roll in.&nbsp;Even in the pre-launch period, Helix has tweaked its ability to create an accurate sleep profile, based both on data (from its beta-test sleepers) and anecdotal experiences. For example, the company learned that terms like "soft" and "firm" can be highly subjective, and vary depending on geography.</p> <p>"Most people in the northeast prefer a firmer feel than in south," says Tishman. That's an interesting finding, in and of itself. But it also means that when you ask someone in the south for their mattress preference on the sliding scale of firm to plush, you have to recognize that their "firm" answer does not mean the same thing as when someone from the northeast says "firm."</p> <h2>Steady Growth, Big Margins</h2> <p>You might wonder whose approach--Casper's or Helix's--will prove to be wiser. But it's closer to the truth to call the $15 billion (U.S.) mattress industry an ever-expanding pie, with room for both traditional, brick-and-mortar players and the bevy of online upstarts.&nbsp;Many of those upstarts are making serious money. Both Tuft and Needle and Casper are selling more than $1 million in mattresses a month. Saatva posted $29 million in 2014 sales and expects at least $50 million this year.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet to say the mattress establishment is atremble at the prospect of a disruption from the upstarts would be a strong exaggeration, notes Joshua Borstein, analyst with Longbow Research.&nbsp;</p> <p>"They are a needle in a haystack compared to Tempur Sealy, with its $3 billion in sales," he says. In Borstein's view, the mattress giants--both makers like Tempur Sealy and retailers like $2-billion Mattress Firm--are "kind of monitoring the situation," but as yet unmoved to action, since the upstarts are scarcely denting the bottom lines of the old vanguard.&nbsp;</p> <p>The established players can afford to sit back because they are thriving. According to industry consultancy Mann Armistead &amp; Epperson, sales for bedding retailers have grown by an annual average of 9.6 percent over the last 12 years.&nbsp;</p> <p>For Helix, the growth of the overall market was a major enticement, as were the relatively low levels of e-commerce penetration for mattress sales. "It's around 5 percent," explains Tishman. "And if you compare it to fashion or furniture, those are more in the 15-20 percent range." Helix's conclusion, based on these numbers and anecdotal research, was that there were consumers who (despite existing online offerings) still didn't feel comfortable purchasing a mattress online. If Helix's personalized solution could help bridge that gap, then Helix could contend for a profitable piece of the industry's continued overall growth.&nbsp;</p> <h2>A Rising Tide</h2> <p>It's still too early to tell what, if any, kind of shake-up will happen to the online mattress market. But pretty much anyone you talk to will praise the job Casper has done of marketing the idea of buying a mattress online.&nbsp;"To be honest, we're bigger than Casper," proclaims Saatva founder Ricky Joshi. "But they're doing a great job with the hype."</p> <p>It sounds like a dig. But Joshi means it as praise. While Casper is far from the inventor of bedding e-commerce--nor is it the only one garnering Warby Parker comparisons--it is easily the leader in capturing the public's attention via social media and the business media. And all of that attention brings consumers to other online mattress startups too.</p> <p>"Casper and a few others have brought a lot of attention to the fact that there are several alternatives," says&nbsp;Daehee Park, co-founder of Tuft &amp; Needle, for whom Bonobos founder Andy Dunn acts as a formal advisor.&nbsp;"A rising tide lifts all boats." With Helix joining the voyage, that rising tide now has one more boat to support.</p></div>",

And inspired by what its founders view as yoga’s benefits to the mind, body, and soul, <a href="https://www.yogabed.com"><strong>Yogabed</strong></a> offers practitioners and non-practitioners alike a foam mattress with a cooling layer to help you wake up replenished.</p><p>For those who still pledge allegiance to the buoyant inner-spring mattress, two companies posses a variety of lavishly appointed options. **<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=100100X1555752&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.saatvamattress.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vogue.com%2Farticle%2Fseven-mattress-startups" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Saatva</a>’**s three models all have inner-spring bases, memory-foam cushioning, and a plush pillow top. In keeping with its green initiative, it uses fire-safe thistle, organic cotton casings, recycled steel, and plant-based foam. A concierge service helps take your online experience off the screen, calling to offer a personal thank you in what cofounder <strong>Ricky Joshi</strong> refers to as “white glove” service. And because Joshi maintains that “certain technologies you can’t fold into a box,” Saatva mattresses are delivered and set up in your home by a dedicated team. Saatva’s sister company, <strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=100100X1555752&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.loomandleaf.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vogue.com%2Farticle%2Fseven-mattress-startups" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Loom &amp; Leaf</a>,</strong> applies the same philosophy to memory-foam mattresses, which are also delivered unfolded to preserve their high-grade cooling gel layer.</p><p>For the most personalized sleep experience, <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=100100X1555752&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fkeetsa.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vogue.com%2Farticle%2Fseven-mattress-startups" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Keetsa</strong></a> offers seven models. Kick back on the beds at one of its bicoastal, lavender-perfumed boutiques—if you haven’t already slept in one. Keetsa supplies bedding for hotels in South Beach, Chicago, Brooklyn, and Manhattan, including the trendy James Hotel. An organic Frankenmuth Woolen Mill comforter (for sale on its site) draped across the Tea Leaf Dream mattress (its multiple-layer, top-of-the-line model) makes for a truly sumptuous night’s rest.

			long_description: "<p>Consumers are getting used to the idea of buying mattresses online, thanks to the rise of companies like&nbsp;Casper&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tuft &amp;&nbsp;Needle. Breaking into the&nbsp;market without the benefit of VC funding meant Saatva had to take a different tack, though.</p><p>So far, it seems to be working for the 5-year-old online mattress seller. With its product&nbsp;starting at $899, Saatva is on track to bring in $120 million in revenue in 2015, up from $28 million in 2014. And the company has been profitable since its third month. Here are four&nbsp;keys to its success:</p><p><strong>Luxury quality</strong><br> Saatva went for the&nbsp;high end of the market. It offers a double-layered inner-springboard bed that’s luxury quality, made in the U.S., organic and hypoallergenic. Unlike Casper and Tuft &amp;&nbsp;Needle, Saatva’s beds can’t be folded up and stuffed into a box. Instead, they’re delivered to consumers’ doors anywhere in the U.S. through the company’s concierge service, coming from 31 distribution centers, which also sets up the bed with the proper foundation and remove the old mattress.</p><p><strong>Careful spending</strong><br> Casper has raised $70 million to date. But without VC funding, Saatva has to be obsessed with data and especially careful with how it spends its money.</p> <p>“We have to be profitable in order to scale the company,” said CMO and co-founder Ricky Joshi. “So, we’ve been very disciplined since day one.”</p> <p>Saatva can’t spring for the big&nbsp;New York City subway wraps and national TV ads of&nbsp;flush-with-cash startups like Casper and Jet.com. So it runs small advertising tests and then scales up&nbsp;gradually. Joshi said that local ads&nbsp;have performed&nbsp;well for the company; a New York Times Home section print ad resulted in a 2,000 percent spike in referrals from the paper. Saatva has also run print ads&nbsp;in Vogue and cities’ lifestyle magazines&nbsp;aimed&nbsp;at&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;over&nbsp;35.</p> <p><strong>Varied product offerings</strong><br>While others sell memory foam or innerspring mattresses, Saatva claims to be the only online mattress company to sell both. Its memory foam business, titled Loom and Leaf, is projected to bring in&nbsp;$30 million in revenue this year, about double expectations,&nbsp;with a 2 percent return rate.</p> <p><strong>Consumer reviews</strong><br>Rave reviews have become a viable source of word-of-mouth&nbsp;marketing for the brand. Everyone who purchases a Saatva mattress is asked by the company to write a review, which helps Saatva reach those in the research process of buying a mattress.</p><p>“We might not be in your face, but anyone who does their due diligence before buying a mattress is going to come across what people are saying about us,” Joshi said.</p><p>It also helps that the company is loved by mommy and eco-friendly bloggers alike, which helps&nbsp;Saatva reach its target consumers.</p><p>“We’re actually the only e-commerce, vertically integrated company not targeting millennials,” Joshi said.</p><p>Josh Goldman, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners, said that while there’s no wrong way to start a company, VC funding can fund star&nbsp;hires and build connections for a young company.</p><p>“Not to mention, the mattress industry is capital intensive — it takes a lot to design, test and build a bed,” said Goldman. “But, if you can do it without venture capital, it’s not the wrong thing to do. It can show independence.”</p>",

			long_description: "<p><strong>Can new e-commerce brand Loom &amp; Leaf take on memory foam giant Tempur-Pedic?</strong></p> <p>Over the last fifteen years, e-commerce has transformed the retail industry. At the beginning of this “e-revolution,” only products like books, movies and collectors’ items, which were obviously easy to sell online, attracted serious competitors. Over the years, entrepreneurs have become increasingly daring and creative, inventing ways to compete in product categories previously assumed to require brick and mortar presences. In 2011, Saatva began to tear down the barriers to successful e-commerce in the mattress industry by focusing on quality and great service. In 2014, this online only mattress business generated $29 million in revenue and has clearly proven that the online market for mattresses is viable and healthy.</p> <p>I had a chance to sit down with Mr. Joshi, co-founder of <a rel="

Anyone who has ever spent hours wandering throughout a warehouse-like showroom can attest to this. First, you’ve got the traditional markups from stores paying for floor space, inefficient advertising, etc. But the problems go a step further. The industry is dominated by four manufacturers who intentionally make it difficult to compare prices, often changing just a stitch so that similar models are “different” across retailers. Pair that with high markups and unfair practices, and you’re paying $3,500 for a mattress that costs $700 to make. </p><p>What’s worse, mattress stores are known for terrible customer service. As an e-commerce company selling our own brand and product, we are able to take the opposite approach. Our customer service reps call customers the day they make their purchase. If a customer has a problem, they then have a direct line of contact who will do almost anything to make that customer happy. </p><p><em>L: Why did you launch Loom &amp; Leaf as a different brand?</em></p> <p>R: Saatva is the original online disrupter of the mattress industry; our value proposition is bringing formerly expensive eco-friendly luxury mattresses to market at an accessible price. We are the largest, online-only mattress company and we grew 270% last year. However, as we were building Saatva we noticed a big difference between memory foam and innerspring shoppers. Memory foam shoppers self-identified themselves and were looking for a very specific bedding experience. We put Tempur-Pedic in our sightlines and spent a year and a half figuring out how to bring the Saatva model to the memory foam space -selling a fully-featured $3500 luxury memory foam mattress for about 1/3 the price. Saatva and Loom &amp; Leaf are for different customers; we believe our two brands now offer the ideal solution for both types.</p><p><em>L: So how does Loom &amp; Leaf fare against Tempur-Pedic?</em></p><p>R: Tempur-Pedic is the best selling mattress brand in the United States. Loom and Leaf in many ways pushes the technology, luxury, and environmental boundaries beyond the big players, and can do this much more affordably. Our cooling technology is the best available.We offer one of the only affordable, eco-responsible premium memory foam mattresses. We use biofoam, organic cotton, and a natural thistle fire retardant, giving Americans an accessible, natural alternative. The legacy companies have not embraced many of the healthier, newer best of breed technologies. And other new start-ups don’t pursue this higher-end market, leaving us in a unique space.</p><p><em>L: Can you explain more about these other start-ups? What are you able to do that they can’t?</em></p><p>R: Every other mattress start-up follows the “bed in a box” model. This requires the mattress to be vacuum-sealed and sent to the customer via UPS or Fed-ex. In fact this is a much easier approach. But boxing creates issues with off-gassing, foam selection, weight, and thickness. State of the art technologies, such as new types of cooling layers, are tough to incorporate. So the customer must make a quality sacrifice when buying this type of product. </p><p>On the other hand, Loom &amp; Leaf is delivered directly into the customer’s home by full-service delivery people, nationwide. This means there are no product limitations, and Loom &amp; Leaf is free to directly challenge high-end companies like Tempur-Pedic. It also means we are able to offer a frame, box spring, and convenient services such as installation. We’ll even remove your old mattress set. If you want a firmer or softer mattress, we’ll exchange it for another model. If you have a large home or live in a three-story town home, in-home installation and mattress removal sounds much more appealing than a wet box on your doorstep.</p><p><em>L: Sounds good, but how are you able to handle such a wide-scale distribution network as an e-commerce company?</em></p><p>R: It’s taken four years, but through Saatva we’ve built a network of 12 factories and 35 distribution centers throughout the country. Throughout we have maintained strict product quality control and delivery standards. We actually monitor our deliveries in every city and location in the US. Having this delivery network also means that on average, our mattresses travel less than 100 miles from factory to bedroom. It was difficult, but thankfully we employ an amazing team that understood this unique challenge.</p><p><em>L: Thanks for your time and all the great insights. I wish you the best.</em></p></blockquote><p>Loom &amp; Leaf is a great example of entrepreneurs strategically identifying a problem in an inefficient, large market and carefully crafting a business plan to deliver a better solution. It is this kind of ingenuity and creativity that creates jobs, improves our quality of life and drives our economy. Our job as entrepreneurs is to follow the example of Loom and Leaf by challenging the status quo and competing fiercely with integrity. Thanks for leading the way Ricky!</p>",

			long_description: "<p>Convenience, variety, and discounted prices are literally at our fingertips when we shop online. E-commerce has revolutionized the way we shop; we no longer have to leave our houses or even get dressed to make an important purchase.</p><p>Similarly, online-only companies have forever changed how much we spend. Exclusively online enterprises offer market minimum prices by eliminating fixed and overhead costs (like rent, commission, and utilities) associated with brick and mortar retail outlets. With fewer employees and no middlemen, these companies are able to bring their products directly to consumers at prices traditional retailers simply cannot match. Several companies utilizing this efficient and innovative business model have recently emerged, disrupting their respective industries and garnering media attention and rapidly growing fan bases.</p><p>Prescription eyewear company, Warby Parker, sells hip, stylish glasses at affordable prices, far below the market average, by selling strictly online. Competing with designer prescription eye frame dealers where prices stretch to several hundred dollars, Warby Parker vends glasses starting at a mere $95. The company operates through a website that virtually models their frames and through which shoppers can request five pairs of glasses to try on at home. With only 150 employees, Warby Parker boasts more than $50 million in profits and even donates a pair of glasses for every purchased pair to underprivileged individuals. To date, 250,000 pairs have been distributed by this company, whose business model, customer service, and corporate social responsibility are disrupting eyewear giant Luxotica’s monopoly over the prescription glasses industry.</p><p>Saatva, an online-only mattress retailer, is proving equally disruptive in the mattress market. The company offers its patented ultra-premium luxury mattresses at prices up to 70% off what traditional mattress retailers charge for comparable beds. Saatva allows customers to shop online, removing the frustration generally associated with mattress shopping, while providing a stress-free, yet always-on-call customer service experience. Consumers are additionally extended a penalty free 30-day home trial. Saatva’s outstanding customer service culture and hand-crafted, American-made products made to last 10-15 years have helped the brand become the top rated mattress on Google for 2012-2013.</p><p>Fellow e-tailer, Everlane, sells its own clothing brand, much like American Apparel, but at a fraction of their prices. All items included on Everlane.com are sold for less than $100. In a refreshing demonstration of transparency, Everlane displays the true cost of each product and then reveals the retailer markup, attempting to show consumers the actual value of their purchases. Much like Warby Parker and Saatva, Everlane retails high quality products. Yet while other designer retailers often mark up clothing by eight times before reaching the consumer, Everlane has created the first designer clothing brand that is considered affordable by consumers.</p><p>Companies like Warby Parker, Saatva, and Everlane are industry disruptors, challenging market giants that once dominated their economic ecosystems, and acquiring ever-increasing followings. Thanks to efficient online-only business models, these companies additionally have a boundless capacity for hyper-growth. Yet most importantly, online-only retailers afford consumers the benefit of high quality products at affordable prices with all the convenience of the online shopping experience.</p>",
